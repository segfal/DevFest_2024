# Inspiration
Did you know that a staggering 49.5% of teens in the US grapple with mental health issues? Confronted by this alarming statistic, we were inspired to harness the transformative power of code to make a tangible impact on their lives. The question became not just "How can code fix that?" but rather, "How can we leverage technology to be a beacon of support and understanding for those navigating the complexities of mental health?"

# What it does
Mind-Guard is a Google Chrome extension designed to be a guardian for mental well-being. It intelligently blocks potentially triggering content on YouTube feeds, providing a safer online environment for users navigating through the ups and downs of their mental health journey.

# How we built it
Motivated by the urgent need revealed by the statistic, our team delved into the intricacies of code and development. Mind-Guard was meticulously crafted using cutting-edge web technologies, machine learning algorithms, and user-friendly interfaces to create a solution that directly responds to the mental health concerns affecting a significant portion of the teenage population. Our project was built using

# Challenges we ran into
This hackathon proved no easy feat. As we confronted the statistics head-on, we encountered challenges that underscored the urgency of our mission. Fine-tuning content analysis algorithms and addressing privacy concerns became critical aspects of our development process.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Mind-Guard stands as a testament to our commitment to tackling mental health challenges. The positive impact it can have on users is a source of pride for our team. As we confront the statistics, our accomplishment lies in creating a tool that promotes empathy, understanding, and real change.

# What we learned
Our journey with Mind-Guard taught us not only about the technical intricacies of development but also about the profound intersection of technology and mental health statistics. The experience provided invaluable lessons on ethical design, user-centric development, and the potential of technology to create positive societal shifts.

# What's next for mind-guard
Our commitment extends beyond the hackathon. We are dedicated to refining and expanding Mind-Guard, ensuring its effectiveness and accessibility. With further development, we hope to grow our extension is many ways-- more features within youtube, add more categories and even apply is to other popular social media platforms. There are plenty out there in need of a feature like this.
